# Advent_of_Code_2017
This project will cover each of the 25 days of the Advent of Code 2017 (http://www.adventofcode.com/) challenge. Each day will be added as a separate
Python project under the Advent_of_Code_2017.sln solution file.

The solutions to the daily challenges will be written in Python 3.6 with the PEP8 style. If any of the challenges require a user interface wxPython
4.0.0b2 will be used.
